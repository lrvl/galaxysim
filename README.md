# Terminal Galaxy Simulator: ASCII Spiral Galaxy Animation

## Description

This project is a bash script that simulates and animates a spiral galaxy using ASCII characters in your terminal. It incorporates various astrophysical concepts to create a scientifically inspired, visually appealing representation of a spiral galaxy.

## Features

- Simulates spiral arm structure
- Incorporates galactic rotation curves
- Simulates star formation and evolution
- Represents dust lanes and star clusters
- Includes effects of dark matter on galactic structure
- Animates galaxy growth and rotation
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the simulation

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Standard Unix utilities: `seq`, `awk`, `sort`, `tr`, `bc`
- A terminal that supports ANSI color codes

## Customization

You can adjust various parameters at the beginning of the script to customize the simulation:

- `NUM_ARMS`: Number of spiral arms
- `CENTRAL_BRIGHTNESS`: Brightness of the galactic center
- `DUST_DENSITY`: Density of dust lanes
- `CLUSTER_CHANCE`: Probability of star cluster formation
- `ASYMMETRY_FACTOR`: Degree of asymmetry in the galaxy
- `ARM_TIGHTNESS`: How tightly wound the spiral arms are

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the simulation or add new features are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes.
